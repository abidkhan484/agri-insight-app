# 🛠️ Implementation Tasks — Advanced Technology

This section contains the **technical implementation task breakdown** for each tool defined in the [Advanced Technology](/docs/advanced-technology/) roadmap. Each task file follows a consistent structure:

- **Objective**: What the task delivers.
- **Prerequisites**: What must be ready before starting.
- **Subtasks**: Granular, actionable checklist items grouped by phase.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the task is done.
- **Estimated Effort**: Time to complete.
- **Dependencies**: Cross-tool dependencies, if any.

## Priority Order

Tasks are ordered by **implementation dependency** and **farmer impact**:

| Priority | Task | Tool | Why First? |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Shared Foundation | — | Database, bot, and hosting setup shared across tools |
| P1 | Farm Scheduler Bot | A | Core infrastructure — bot + DB reused by B, D, E, H |
| P2 | Weather Irrigation Alert | B | Plugs directly into Bot A's Telegram + cron infra |
| P3 | Farm Record Tracker | D | Core data model used by E (IoT) and reporting |
| P4 | IoT Soil Monitoring | E | Depends on D's data model + A's Telegram alerts |
| P5 | Plant Disease Detection | C | Independent ML pipeline, start MVP with API |
| P6 | ZBNF Knowledge PWA | F | Independent offline app, content-heavy |
| P7 | Local AI Assistant | G | Depends on docs content being finalized |
| P8 | Community Farmer Network | H | Aggregates all tools, deploy last |
